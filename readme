As an intern at Boston SCORES in summer 2019, I was tasked with locating and pasting contact and parent information for 60-70 students 
enrolled in the summer academy. This information was searchable in the Boston Public School database, scattered in a trove of the 400+ 
students enrolled overall in the district. I was able to export this data to a csv file. The code herein finds the relevant student data
for the roster and puts it all into a new csv, which can then be exported to a spreadsheet for practical use.
